The IoT Led project demonstrates controlling an LED connected to a Raspberry Pi using a web application built 
with Node.js and Express.js. The project leverages the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol to enable 
communication between the web application and a public MQTT broker, allowing you to control the LED remotely.
